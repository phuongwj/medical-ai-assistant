# Medical AI Assistant

## Purpose

This project proposes a solution to the problem of clinician administrative burdens through a simple chat application. The chatbot uses a lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to answer frequently asked questions related to the medical centre. Currently, due to university's finals and the tight project deadline, the current implementation is intentionally limited to information found in the FAQ documents. Despite its simplicity, the broader long-term goal of this project is to explore how RAG-based chatbots can meaningfully reduce administrative workload for clinicians.
