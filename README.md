# Medical AI Assistant

## Purpose

This is a capstone project for Dalhousie Cloud Computing course - CSCI 3124, where you can choose to make any kinds of applications and have to make sure that it works on the Cloud.

## Small note

This is a simple chat application between doctor and patient, I initially didn't want to add the word "AI" to the project cause I don't want to jinx it. I want to have a good base first (i.e. a chat application with frontend + backend + cloud integration) then will incorporate AWS Bedrock or a local/open-source model for the actual RAG-implementation if I have enough time.
